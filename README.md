As far as i know this requires:
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
- Windows forms

You play as a delivery drone who must deliver their parcels day by day within time, an opposing delivery company isn't very happy about this, and will strive to destory you at all costs.

Both you and your enemies are equipped with weapons, to shoot eachother of course.

The wind will act as a problem for both you and the enemy, messing up movement.

At the end of a day you will have the opportunity to purchase upgrades for your delivery drone.

Game carries on until the player has had enough, with increasing difficulties.
